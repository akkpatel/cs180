 * Program name: CheckPrimality
 * 
 * Description:
 * 
 * This program takes an integer as input and checks if it
 * is prime or not. This program is intended to be used 
 * in Lab 2 to understand what we mean by "Play-and-Learn".
 * You will likely not understand all aspects of this
 * program but it will help you enter the play-and-learn realm 
 * of programming.
 * 
 * There are two other versions of this program that we will make available to
 * you at a later date. One of these is a multithreaded version and the other a
 * multithreaded and GUI version. Both versions are much
 * more fun to dissect, but more complex too!

 * *************************************************************************
 * 
 * Lab tasks A: Pre-compilation 
 * 
 * Spend a few minutes browsing this program and try to
 * answer the following questions prior to compiling it.
 * 
 * 1. List all classes used explicitly methods in this program.
 * 2. List all methods defined as well as used in this program.
 * 3. For each method, list its return type.
 * 4. What is the purpose of the Scanner class?
 * 5. What does the println() method do?
 * 6. Can you locate the constructor for CheckPrimality?
 * 7. List all the primitive types used in this program.
 * 8. After having browsed the program, can you explain 
 * the method used here to check for primality?
 * 9. What differences and similarities do you notice in the naming of classes,
 * methods, and variables? 
 * 
 * Lab tasks B: Post-compilation
 * 
 * 1. Compile and run the program. 
 *    When asked for a number input the following strings (one on each request):
 * 
 *   104,395,301
 *    1234560
 *    123gg22
 *    -3
 *    0
 * What happens when you type a non-number?
 * 
 * Lab tasks C: Tracing
 * 
 * 1. Add a breakpoint at the following statement:
 * 
 * isItPrime(num);
 * 
 * 2. Add variable num to the watch list.
 * 3. Compile the program.
 * 4. Enable Debug Mode.
 * 5. Now run the program first with input 13, then with input 14, and lastly with input 
 * 4gg. Trace the program using SkipInto and Skip Over options.
 * 5. Play as much as you wish with the tracing features and try to
 * learn how to trace through the program.
 * 6. Remove all breakpoints.
