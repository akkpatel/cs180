/*
 * Program name: CheckPrimeConc
 * 
 * Decsription:
 * This program demonstrates how multiple threads can be used to check for primality of a positive integer.
 * The programs asks the user to enter an integer. It then
 * uses two threads to check for the primality of the number input. 
 * The given number is checked against  divisors from 2 until sqrt(number).
 * One thread checks for divisibility by numbers from 2 till sqrt(number)/2 and
 * the other by numbers from sqrt(number)/2+1 until sqrt(number).
 * If neither thread is able to find the divisor then the number
 * is prime else it is not.

 * 
 * The student should carefully note the following:
 * 
 * 1. How the program is structured into one class and several methods.
 * 2. How threads are created and started.
 * 3. How the main() method waits for both threads to stop functioning.
 * 4. The use of variable names, especially the use of the same name in 
 * different contents (e.g. num).
 * 
 * Play with the program:
 * 1. Locate the two constructors. Remove the first one, which is empty. Now compile the program.
 * Does the program compile?
 * 
 * 2. How many threads does this program create? 
 * 
 * 3. Is there any difference in the code executed by each thread created?
 * 
4. Modify the program so it prints the total elapsed time to check if
 * the given number is a prime. Compile and run the modified program. Then compare the
 * time taken by the multithreaded program against the single threaded
 * program that you have played with in the past. Use the following numbers in your experiment:
 * 104729 
 * 611953
 * 595453013  
 * 3300451039 
 * 9990454997 

5. Are the two threads independent? Is there any chance of a deadlock?

6. [Advanced exercise] Modify the program so that it uses three threads 
to check for primality. Then compare the time taken by the modified program
with that of the program with two threads. Use the numbers listed above to
compare the execution times.
